A card game from the mind of higbeej16 digitalized by NMCameron

Introduction
=
First and foremost, "Jacobs Big Hogged Card Game" is a turn and resource based card game.
Each turn is broken down into four phases.

Phase One - Initial Summon
    During this phase you will be able to choose which unit you wish to summon. A unit must wait one phase before it is able to act.
    You also regen one mana during this phase as well
    ***Issue- If we wish to make this into a real time game, the gameplay of this may get tricky with other units potentially moving while this one has to wait**

Phase Two - Movement
    Fairly self explanitory, troops ***must*** move during this phase, unless they are in combat.

Phase Three - Attack
    During attack phase, units must attack the nearest unit to them, ranged characters included.
    If two units occupy the same space the player is then able to choose which to attack.

Phase Four - Final Summon
    Last chance to Summon a unit before the mana regen stage in phase one.

Instructions
=
You begin by selecting the troops you wish to use for the game from the troop pool
    You select your troops at the same time as your opponent to promote fair play (and prevent decks built purely to counter.)

Once selected you are able to select how strong you wish for them to be
    You do this by assigning them a unique value from 1-10 
    Ex: If you pick the Knight card, and choose to make it level 10, you may not have another card that is level 10
